fingerpoken - use your iphone/ipad as a mouse

Video demo: 
* Mouse control: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39PtZoxW_fM
* TiVo control: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUkVDrAFbY

What works:
* dragging a finger moves the mouse.
* tap clicks, 2-finger tap right-clicks, 3 finger-tap middle-clicks
* two-finger drag up/down scrolls
* double tap clicks twice, etc.
* tap-drag works like you might expect (select text, etc).
* arbitrary keyboard input (do a 90-degree clockwise rotation with two fingers,
click on the text area that pops up)

Configuring the UI:
* The 'config' button lets you change a few things:
  * 'mouse movement' can be relative (normal touchpad), absolute (not supported yet), and vector (start-point + current-point == mouse direction and speed)
  * You can change the mouse sensitivity.

Options set in the UI will persist across sessions using HTML5 localStorage.

What's planned:
* security (https, authentication)
* many other things.
* Better PC-as-a-client support (mousemovement, clicking, etc)

What you need to run it:
  client:
    * client: an iphone or ipad running iOS >=4.2 (requires websocket support in safari)
  server:
    * ruby
    * rubygems: em-websocket, eventmachine, ffi, async_sinatra, json, rack
    * For the xdo target: libxdo (from the xdotool project)
    * For the vnc target: rubygem eventmachine-vnc
    * For the tivo target: nothing.
    * Linux, and X server. OS X and Windows support is probably easy.

Run it:

  * xdo (X11): fingerpoken.rb -t xdo:///
  * vnc: fingerpoken.rb -t vnc:///  # no user/auth/host target yet, hack the source :(
  * tivo: fingerpoken.rb -t tivo://yourtivoip

1) Run fingerpoken 
2) Point your iphone browser at http://yourmachine:5000/
3) Use your phone as a touchpad.

Optional:
* Bookmark to home screen. Works from there, too.

TODO:
* Add VNC protocol support (Done!)
* Test on Windows
* Test on OS X
* Swipe-horizontal sends left/right?

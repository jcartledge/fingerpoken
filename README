fingerpoken - use your iphone/ipad as a mouse

Video demo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39PtZoxW_fM

What works:
* dragging a finger moves the mouse.
* tap clicks, 2-finger tap right-clicks, 3 finger-tap middle-clicks
* two-finger drag up/down scrolls
* double tap clicks twice, etc.
* tap-drag works like you might expect (select text, etc).
* arbitrary keyboard input (do a 90-degree clockwise rotation with two fingers,
click on the text area that pops up)

What's planned:
* security (https, authentication)
* many other things.

What you need to run it:
  client:
    * client: an iphone or ipad running iOS >=4.2 (requires websocket support in safari)
  server:
    * ruby
    * rubygems: em-websocket, eventmachine, ffi, async_sinatra, json, rack
    * libxdo (from the xdotool project)
    * Linux, and X server. OS X and Windows support is probably easy.

Run it:
1) Run this on the workstation you want to control: ruby fingerpoken.rb
2) Point your iphone browser at http://yourmachine:5000/
3) Use your phone as a touchpad.

Optional:
* Bookmark to home screen. Works from there, too.

TODO:
* Add VNC protocol support
* Test on Windows
* Test on OS X
* Add better UI to select: typing, arrows, mouse clicks, etc.
* Configuration UI (saves using web storage)
* Swipe-horizontal sends left/right?

fingerpoken - use your iphone/ipad as a mouse

What works:
* dragging a finger moves the mouse.
* tapping clicks
* double tap clicks twice, etc.
* tap-drag works like you might expect.

What's planned:
* arbitrary keyboard input.
* security (https, authentication)
* many other things.

What you need to run it:
* ruby
* rubygems: em-websocket, eventmachine, ffi, async_sinatra, json, rack
* libxdo (from the xdotool project)

Run it:
1) Run: ruby fingerpoken.rb
2) Point your iphone browser at http://yourmachine:5000/
3) Use your phone as a touchpad.

Optional:
* Bookmark to home screen. Works from there, too.
